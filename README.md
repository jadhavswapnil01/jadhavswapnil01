# üëã Hi there! I'm Swapnil Jadhav

I'm an engineering student who treats Computer Science as both a playground and a puzzle box. My journey began with childhood curiosity about gadgets and has evolved into a full-blown passion for building tech that genuinely helps people (and sometimes just makes life more interesting).
